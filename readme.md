### @stnnnghm

This project will be completed in several iterations. The steps are to be completed as follows. I may or may not change the README when it is done.
1. **Create the Service**
2. Improve the Service
3. Upgrade for Web
4. Add SSE
5. Simple JS Frontend
6. Frontend-Backend Comms
7. Server-Side Logging
8. Docker Implementation

Check back for progress, I got the idea for the project from [Petr Jahoda](https://petrjahoda.medium.com/), Medium.com.
